# Install our React frontend

Time to make a face for our application.

Install React. You may have to use **sudo** if you use the -g "globally" flag. 
```
npm install -g create-react-app`
```

In your route folder where package.json is run the following command
You can substitute **starter-frontend** with another name if mine doesn't suit your fancy. 
```
create-react-app starter-frontend`
``
```
cd starter-frontend`
```

Start the app 
```
npm start
```
